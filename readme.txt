==== WordPress Restaurant Menu Builder plugin ====

Introducing WP Darko's new restaurant menu builder. We've designed this WordPress plugin to be as user-friendly as possible, making it ideal for beginners. You can begin building captivating food lists within minutes.

When activated, WP Darko's restaurant menu builder will add two new sections to your WordPress admin panel: "Food Items" and "Food Menus." These sections will enable you to effortlessly create restaurant menus by adding food items (complete with food descriptions, regular and sale prices, food images, and more), add them to one or multiple menus and display them anywhere on your website using your restaurant menu shortcodes.

==== Drag & Drop Restaurant Menu Builder ====

Restaurant Food Menu is an intuitive drag & drop food menu builder plugin for WordPress. After you've added your food items in the admin panel, it only takes a few minutes to display your restaurant menu beautifully on your page. Simply create a new menu, then drag & drop your food items from the food list into your menu sections. Adjust the menu's layout, add headings, and paragraphs to make it look like an authentic restaurant menu, and you're good to go!

With this WordPress plugin, WP Darko ensures that you can focus on what matters most: your restaurant business. Creating a restaurant menu for your WordPress site is easy with our menu builder, and you should be able to have yours ready in minutes.

==== Available fields & settings ====

When creating food items in the admin panel, you'll be able to use the following fields:

- Food title
- Food image
- Regular and sale price: if you add a sale price to your food item, the regular price will be crossed out
- Additional info: this is a free field where you can add information about the food, such as spiciness level, allergies, gluten-free, vegetarian, and more
- Food description: here is where you can let your creativity shine and describe your food in a way that makes it sound delicious to your visitors

==== Fully Responsive and Optimized ====
Restaurant Food Menu is a 100% mobile-friendly and fully responsive restaurant menu builder plugin for WordPress that has been tested with a wide range of devices and browsers.

The menu's food sections will gracefully transition from 3-2 columns to a single column on smaller devices, ensuring they remain perfectly readable and visually appealing.

Our WordPress restaurant menu plugin is also fully compatible with the latest versions of WordPress and PHP.
